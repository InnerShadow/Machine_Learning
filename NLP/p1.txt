I long since forgot how to love.
Feelings cannot be trampled, my heart’s like a metal glove.
But when I bumped into you in the early spring
You rejected me with a deep sting.

It was anger that drove me to be the best in all.
I wanted to show I blaze as a fireball.
How the world can change and it’s all about you!
How a monster awakes inside and breaks through!
 
My blood is right here.
Can you see it? I give it to you.
Love has no fear.
The fire helps me to fight and burns anew!
You’re like a star in the skies,
The dawn takes me away from your eyes.
Your dislike I can’t deny!
More and more the fire in me multiplies!
 
What could I possibly change right now?
I was your shadow and fate somehow.
But your mind wandered in darkness in the past.
You can't see what I’ve become at last.
 
Time was running away and changing me on the run;
There are not many things for me that couldn’t be done.
If you are really foolish enough not to love me,
I’ll get the will to make you and your kind not to be!
 
My blood is right here.
Can you see it? I give it to you.
Love has no fear.
The fire helps me to fight and burns anew!
You’re like a star in the skies,
The dawn takes me away from your eyes.
Your dislike I can’t deny!
More and more the fire in me multiplies!
