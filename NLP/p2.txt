I have not seen people for several years.
I thought after the war they were nowhere to be found.
But this morning ... I've found a trail!
 
There is little water in the world and you cannot drink it,
Infected flesh is thrown everywhere to rot.
You need a disaster to evaluate:
What is garbage, and where is the Light of Life ?!
 
This love takes me away!
Look, she's everywhere!
This love has opened you
For me - and be a miracle!
 
I remember: a fire storm! Impenetrable darkness!
Eight months night! And 3 years winter!
These are people who have gone crazy over money!
 
All the wealth of people is dirt and rot!
So let the dead guard their own!
Itâ€™s priceless for me to meet her,
This new life is beyond death!
 
This love takes me away!
Look, she's everywhere!
This love has opened you
For me - and be a miracle!
 
You are waiting for me up there ...
It is like a new life beyond death!
