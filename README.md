1. binary_classification.py is a simple binary classification task using the perceptron algorithm. It features a fixed coefficient omega[1] while updating omega[0]. The primary purpose is to demonstrate basic binary classification with a visually plotted decision boundary at the end.
2. FLD is the task involves binary classification without iterative or numerical methods, but rather relies on the mathematical framework, utilizing the Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) loss function.
3. SGD is a binary classification task using the gradient descent algorithm and the sigmoid activation function. Stochastic algorithm with pseudo-gradients. Output of the separating hyperplane and a plot of the quality metric (Q) at each iteration at the end of the program.
4. L2-regularizer is еру L2-Regularizer task of approximating the original graph with a high-degree polynomial. Enhancing model prediction properties through L2 regularization with varying lambda coefficients, all while preserving the richness of the feature space.
