1. binary_classification.py is a simple binary classification task using the perceptron algorithm. It features a fixed coefficient omega[1] while updating omega[0]. The primary purpose is to demonstrate basic binary classification with a visually plotted decision boundary at the end.
2. FLD is the task involves binary classification without iterative or numerical methods, but rather relies on the mathematical framework, utilizing the Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) loss function.
